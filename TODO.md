### Todo
- [ ] Change all current PCB layouts to match new top layout (INST REG bus)
  - [x] Control
  - [x] Program Counter
  - [x] Register
- [ ] Add decoupling capacitors for every 74xx IC (Vias to GND/PWR planes)
- [ ] ISA
  - [ ] Figure out Load/Add Upper/Lower PC
- [ ] Modules
  - [ ] LEDs
    - [ ] Clock Signal LED
    - [ ] Reset Button
    - [ ] 5v Barrel Jack
  - [ ] Registers
    - [X] Bottom
    - [ ] Upper layers
  - [ ] Control
    - [ ] Add Instruction Register
    - [ ] 74HC161's for Addressing?
    - [ ] Add inverters
  - [ ] Clock
  - [ ] Memory
    - [ ] Input
      - [ ] Data
      - [ ] Address
      - [ ] Buttons & DIP Switches/Different PCB outline (On ends, like REG LEDs
    - [ ] RAM
  - [ ] ALU
  - [ ] EEPROM Programmer
  - [ ] 7-segment output display

### FUTURE
- [ ] ROM for IMEM, interchangeable module
- [ ] 2nd output port, could have as many as 8
- [ ] Interchangeable, less beefy ALU?

### CODE
- [ ] Simple "Assembler"
- [ ] Add ISA Docs/Schematic Images
