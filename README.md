# RPU-8
8-Bit Retro Processing Unit

Started on breadboards, inspired by Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU.  I got it more or less working on breadboards, and I am currently designing PCBs to make it more permanent and hopefully solve any power distribution or connection issues with the breadboard design.  I have sketched out a modular stacking design, so it will be easier to swap out for larger instruction/data memory or a larger program counter if I so please.

I am using KiCAD for schematic and PCB design.  Planning to source PCBs from JLCPCB.

TODO: Add images of breadboard.
